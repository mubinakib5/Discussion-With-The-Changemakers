                    "Discussion with the Changemakers" (DWC) is a youth-driven platform that empowers young people to address real-world urban challenges through innovation, dialogue, and collaboration with city leaders. Specifically designed to harness the potential of Chattogram's youth, DWC Chapter 02, scheduled for July 1-17, 2025, at Hotel Agrabad, offers a transformative opportunity for students to grow, lead, and make a lasting impact.

                  <p className="text-justify">
                    DWC provides a unique platform for youth to tackle significant urban challenges in Chattogram, such as infrastructure, sustainability, or public services. Participants work in teams to identify city problems, conduct fieldwork, and develop actionable solutions, with the potential for 3-5 of these solutions to be selected by city authorities for implementation. This direct connection to policy makers, including the CDA Chairman, City Mayor, Ward Councilors, and Members of Parliament (MPs), ensures that your ideas can lead to tangible improvements in your community. By participating, you're not just theorizing but actively contributing to sustainable urban development, making DWC a powerful avenue for creating real-world impact.
