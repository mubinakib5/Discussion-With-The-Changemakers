                  <p className="text-justify">
                    Discussion with the Changemakers (DWC) Chapter 02 is a pivotal
                    event in the initiative's mission to empower the youth of
                    Chattogram and foster meaningful dialogue with city leaders to
                    address urban challenges. Scheduled for July 1-17, 2025, with
                    the main event on July 17, 2025, at Hotel Agrabad in Chattogram,
                    this chapter builds on the foundation of Chapter 01, which was
                    launched as "a bridge between the youth and city rulers" in
                    collaboration with the City Corporation. This detailed overview
                    elaborates on the specifics of Chapter 02, addresses how DWC's
                    past promotional efforts were limited, outlines the
                    transformative changes for a "changeable look," and explores how
                    the initiative aims to sustain itself in the future.
